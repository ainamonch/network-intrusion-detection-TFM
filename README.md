# Network Intrusion Detection with Machine Learning

The main objective of this work is to develop a solution based on Machine Learning techniques for detecting suspicious activities that could compromise an organization's cybersecurity. The goal is to identify vulnerabilities and network attacks through the analysis of network traffic data.

The project follows an applied research methodology that includes data selection and preprocessing, training of Machine Learning models, and evaluating their performance. For this purpose, the UNSW-NB15 dataset is used, which contains samples of both normal and malicious network traffic and enables the identification of attacks such as Fuzzers, DoS, and Worms, among others.

Different classification systems are compared, including those based on supervised learning techniques (Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM) and unsupervised learning techniques (K-Means and DBSCAN). Deep learning models are also utilized to optimize predictions. Results are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to validate the ability to detect threats.
